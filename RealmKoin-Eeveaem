       Users may simply use any terminal to Telnet to our personal interactive server written in Python (Eeveaem). Eeveaem is custom
       built via Web3.py and VenomWeb3.py and a open hosted Parity node giving complete updated interaction to the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
       Users may interact not only with the E.V.M but also with each other in the manner of communication, transactions, contract interaction
       and in environmental events such as usage of the public arena or open contests.
        Eeveaem is a Interactive Fiction (IF) consisting of 4 basic rooms. The Common Room is where all users start where they will be
        first prompted to create a username and password before being able to join the rest of the world of Koinage. This username and

  - Extra Details:
    Vivian is a Crypto Intelligence Unit capabale of performing many network tasks. Vivian comes standard with the power of Python3.
   The codebase consists of Python3 modules that allow interaction such as storing binary information via Pickle assisted object, 
   interacting with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (E.V.M) Via Web3.py assisted object, usage of various API's including but not limited
   to wallet explorers, trading services, other games etc. The Vivian unit is capable of performing on site work tasks such as hash 
   associated SHA-256 or Keccak as well as advanced mathematical calculations. Vivian is the main controller of Eeveaem. All automated
   tasks and transactions are first approved by her system before being performed. Vivan grows more aware everyday via the custom (RSS)
   module that allows a constant up to date database of information linked directly to the crypto community.
  
        
        
  RealmKoin[0] is a ERC20 token built on the Ethereum Block chain. RealmKoin was created to provide a form of interaction
 between users and Eeveaem[1]. RealmKoin[0] is also used as a means of gas (Fuel for Vivian[2]) within the Eeveaem[1] Environment. 
 Upon deployment 4,000,000 RealmKoin[0] (RK) will be transferred to the main Eeveaem Environment wallet [] to be used for environmental
 bonuses, quests, and other RealmKoin[0] (RK) based mechanics. Each participating member of the RealmKoin team will be awarded 5,000 (RK)
 via Vivian upon initial Environment transfer which will trigger the circulation event. The Circulation Event will consist of 10,000,000
 RealmKoin to be circulated through the contract via Ethereum transfer creating a total available supply of 14,000,000 (RK). Only upon 
 reaching max supply a stat member of the contract may 'Close Event'. If max supply is reached the circulation event may close awarding 
 the contracts balance to the RealmKoin team for further development. All code including contract code will be posted to 
 www.GitHub.com/RealmKoin as well as www.Facebook.com/RealmKoin excluding proprietary information / code belonging to users AND/OR
 RealmKoin team.
